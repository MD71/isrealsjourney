  <p class="text_1">The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has been amazing to Israel and the Soucier Family. Israel will have to fight
  this battle for the next 3.5 YEARS which will be extremely challenging for Israel and his family. Israel has 3 brothers;
  Cole 14 yoa, Isaiah 10yoa, and Eden 2 yoa. The Soucier Family and the community have come together with so much unconditional
  LOVE and SUPPORT during this most difficult time.</p>

  <p class ="text_1">Between the costs of medical bills, lost wages, and cost of travel to
  Philadelphia from the Jersey Shore several times weekly and a multitude of associated expenses is overwhelming. We are
  asking for support and prayers from our friends, family, and community to assist with the stress that this unexpected medical
  and financial burden has brought on the loving Soucier Family. </p>
